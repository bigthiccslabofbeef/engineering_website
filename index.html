        we finished and tested our rube goldberg machine, after a few trys we managed to pop the ballon
        the first cad is the group cad and the second is my personal cad.

    </p>
    <p>

        last we we made a rocket, when we made the cad it was supposed to be a rocket
        with 3 thrusters with 2 that detatch<br>
        <img src=rcad.png width=500 height=500>
    </p>
    <p>
        but later we changed it to a plane with one thruster,these where the oringinal
        materials, but I made another one with foam board,sticks, and hot glue with some
        ruber bands<br>

        this week we started working on electrical engineering.we learned about the relationship between volts, amps(current), and 
        ohms(resistance).<br> we also learned about resistors which limits the current.
        <br>the main equation we've be using is r=v/i. for example if you want to power 3 LED
        <br>with 0.02A with a 9v battery you would need to divid 9/0.06 giving you 150 for your R.<br>

        this week we continued wourking on breadboarding but we did the real thing,
        and for challenge day we tried to make an argument on which would be better
        writing 1 to 1 mil or going to a math class.we also made a water filter.<br>

        I dont have a video but the bridge we built last semester held the first cup I think.
        During winter break I worked on my car and build warhammer mini's. This week 
        I learnd that there's engineering to business and we're making a shark tank type presentation.
        our idea is to make race car bed but its a spaceship.
