       I learned about the safty rules for the workshop, I also refreshed and learned new things about java in ap comp.
       Right now I'm working on my rube goldberg machine in tinkercad.
       Yesterday, we did a chalenge where we tried to make the best home appliance. I lost.

        9/26/22<br>
        we finished and tested our rube goldberg machine, after a few trys we managed to pop the ballon
        the first cad is the group cad and the second is my personal cad.

        this week we tryed to take apart a laptop but the one we got was wacky
    </p>
    <p>
        10/7/22<br>
        last we we made a rocket, when we made the cad it was supposed to be a rocket
        with 3 thrusters with 2 that detatch<br>
        <img src=rcad.png width=500 height=500>
    </p>
    <p>
        but later we changed it to a plane with one thruster,these where the oringinal
        materials, but I made another one with foam board,sticks, and hot glue with some
        ruber bands<br>

        this week we started working on electrical engineering.we learned about the relationship between volts, amps(current), and 
        ohms(resistance).<br> we also learned about resistors which limits the current.
        <br>the main equation we've be using is r=v/i. for example if you want to power 3 LED
        <br>with 0.02A with a 9v battery you would need to divid 9/0.06 giving you 150 for your R.<br>

        this week we continued wourking on breadboarding but we did the real thing,
        and for challenge day we tried to make an argument on which would be better
        writing 1 to 1 mil or going to a math class.we also made a water filter.<br>

        we started making the spagetti we plan making it with 3 layers 2 zigzag and on thats crosses in the middle

        I dont have a video but the bridge we built last semester held the first cup I think.
        During winter break I worked on my car and build warhammer mini's. This week 
        I learnd that there's engineering to business and we're making a shark tank type presentation.
        our idea is to make race car bed but its a spaceship.

         we made oobleck for chem engineering and our mix turned out well(I dont have pics of the card tower)<br>

         the idea of the design is that when the mouse trap goes off it pulls the rod<br>
         the rod rotates the big gear which rotates the small gear which is part of the rear axel

         this week we started building our cars so far I've only cut out the base of the car<br>
         and I have the gears ready.<br><br>
         for challenge day we had to make something out of popsickle sticks and rubber bands<br>
         we made a cage for it<br>

         my car would have gone side to side if it didn't stray from it's path and if the string<br>
         didn't get stuck.<br><br>
         I abondoned the original car because I got frustrated that it wasn't working and the 3d print shattered.<br>
         I've learned how mouse trap cars work, if the string is the wrong length it will cause it to go backwards.<br>
         If I would try to improve it would add thicker gears for for less flexing of the gears and add stoppers to the side of the middle gear so the<br>
         string doesn't get stuck. I would also get rid of the thing that lets it go in different directions and I would change the string to a thinner one.<br>
